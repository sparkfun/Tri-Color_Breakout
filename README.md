*Tri-Color LED Breakout Kit (KIT-10111)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10111)

A simple breakout board to control three larger LEDs. Each 10mm LED requires 65-75mA to drive the LED at full brightness. This breakout uses basic NPN transistors and current limiting resistors to push each LED to its limit.

The hardware was designed in Eagle v6.3
